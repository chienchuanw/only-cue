# OnlyCue

A native macOS application for lighting designers and show programmers, inspired by [CuePoints](https://cuepoints.com/). Import a media file (audio or video), preview it, and lay out a **cue list** — an ordered set of named, color-coded markers anchored to timestamps — to plan and communicate timing for live shows or TV.

## Status

Scaffolding landed (issue [#1](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/issues/1)). The repo now has the full planning docs, an xcodegen-generated Xcode project skeleton, GitHub issue & PR templates, and SwiftLint. Feature work tracks via the [issue board](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/issues) — start with epic `#3` (skeleton) once C1 ships.

## Build

```bash
brew install xcodegen swiftlint   # one-time
xcodegen generate                  # produces OnlyCue.xcodeproj from project.yml
open OnlyCue.xcodeproj
```

`OnlyCue.xcodeproj/` is generated and gitignored — `project.yml` is the source of truth.
