# OnlyCue

A native macOS application for lighting designers and show programmers, inspired by [CuePoints](https://cuepoints.com/). Import a media file (audio or video), preview it, and lay out a **cue list** — an ordered set of named, color-coded markers anchored to timestamps — to plan and communicate timing for live shows or TV.

## Status

All MVP feature epics (C1, C2, E1–E9) have shipped ([#14](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/pull/14)–[#24](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/pull/24)). E9 polish closed out the feature surface: a saved `.cuelist` whose media file moved now opens with a "Relink media…" alert (security-scoped bookmarks refresh on stale, the missing-file path is surfaced via `asset.load(.duration)`), Space/←/→ drive transport (with a cancellable seek task so keyrepeat doesn't pile up), the document window shows the imported file as a navigation subtitle, a placeholder app icon ships at the standard mac sizes, the About panel reads version + credits, and a one-shot welcome sheet appears on first launch. Next up: [#13](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/issues/13) (C3 release pipeline — Developer ID signing, notarization, DMG via `create-dmg`), which unblocks [#12](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/issues/12) (E10 distribution). Track everything on the [issue board](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/issues).

## Build

```bash
brew install xcodegen swiftlint   # one-time
xcodegen generate                  # produces OnlyCue.xcodeproj from project.yml
open OnlyCue.xcodeproj
```

`OnlyCue.xcodeproj/` is generated and gitignored — `project.yml` is the source of truth.

### When to re-run xcodegen / clean the build folder

- **Re-run `xcodegen generate`** whenever `project.yml`, `Info.plist`, or the source folder structure changes (new top-level folder under `OnlyCue/`, new target, new pre-build script). Pulling a branch that touched any of those counts.
- **`⌘⇧K` (Clean Build Folder)** in Xcode after switching branches that changed Swift concurrency annotations or other compile-time invariants — Xcode's incremental build sometimes hangs on stale bitcode and surfaces it as a confusing build error (e.g., a Swift 6 `@MainActor` error on code that has already been fixed).
- **`⌘⇧⌥K` (Delete Derived Data)** if `⌘⇧K` doesn't clear the issue. Slower (full rebuild after) but resolves persistent stale-cache errors.
