## 2026-05-07 — E3 media import session (PR #18, issue #5)

**Shipped:** issue #5 (E3 media import). PR #18 merged into `dev` (rebase, head `ce3e0ca`). The app can now actually open user-supplied media.

**What landed:**
- `OnlyCue/Utilities/Bookmarks.swift` — `Bookmarks.create(for:) -> Data` and `Bookmarks.resolve(_:) -> Resolution` over `URL.bookmarkData(options: .withSecurityScope)` and `URL(resolvingBookmarkData:bookmarkDataIsStale:)`. `Resolution { url, isStale }` keeps the staleness signal explicit for E9.
- `OnlyCue/Commands/MediaImporter.swift` (new directory) — `@MainActor importMedia(from:into:engine:)`. Validates the URL via `UTType` (`.audio` / `.movie`), creates the bookmark, loads `AVAsset` duration off-main, mutates `document.model.media`, and calls `engine.load(asset:)`. `MediaImportError.unsupportedType(filename:)` for the alert path.
- `OnlyCue/UI/DocumentView.swift` — `Import Media…` button bound to `⌘O`, `.fileImporter(allowedContentTypes: MediaImporter.allowedContentTypes)`, `.dropDestination(for: URL.self)`, `.alert(item:)` driven by an internal `ImportAlert: Identifiable`. Added `mediaSummary` line that shows the imported file name + HH:MM:SS.mmm duration.
- `OnlyCueTests/SilentAudioFixture.swift` — single shared programmatic silent-WAV generator. Replaces three nearly-identical inline copies in `PlayerEngineTests`, `BookmarksTests`, `MediaImporterTests` (-41 LOC after the refactor commit).
- `OnlyCueTests/{Bookmarks,MediaImporter}Tests.swift` — round-trip via temp file, JSON pass-through, invalid-data throw; mediaKind detection (audio/video/unsupported), full importMedia happy path, unsupported throws and leaves model nil.
- `OnlyCue/Media/PlayerEngine.swift` — `@MainActor` on the class; periodic-time-observer closure hops via `MainActor.assumeIsolated { ... }` (queue is already `.main`).

**Build fixes applied mid-session (Swift 6 / macOS 15 SDK):**
- "Main actor-isolated initializer 'init(asset:)' cannot be called from outside of the actor" — fixed by adding `@MainActor` to `PlayerEngine` (commit `12a5015`). This applies the suggestion deferred from PR #17 review; it became load-bearing for the build, so the deferral resolved itself organically.
- "Main actor-isolated property 'currentTime' / 'rate' can not be mutated from a Sendable closure" inside `addPeriodicTimeObserver` — fixed by wrapping the body in `MainActor.assumeIsolated { ... }` (commit `ce3e0ca`). The observer queue is `.main`, so the assumption is sound and avoids per-tick `Task` allocation at 10Hz.

**Manual verification (per `docs/build-sequence.md` detour rule #3, since XCUITest can't drive `NSOpenPanel`/`.dropDestination`):**
- Drag `.mp3` onto window → `mediaSummary` updates with name + duration, transport plays audio.
- ⌘O → file picker filtered to audio + video.
- Drag `.pdf` → "Unsupported file" alert; `ProjectModel.media` stays nil.
- Video preview is intentionally absent (E4 / #6).

**Ad-hoc signing debug attach gotcha:** earlier in the session, Xcode reported "Unable to obtain a task name port right for pid X: (os/kern) failure (0x5)" when running. That's the LLDB-attach failure from `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY: "-"` without a `get-task-allow` entitlement — masking the real Swift 6 build errors above. Lesson captured to `findings.md`: read the **build log** before debugging the runtime error.

## 2026-05-07 — E2 player core session (PR #17, issue #4)

**Shipped:** issue #4 (E2 player core). PR #17 merged into `dev` (rebase, head `2240f5c`). First media-handling code.

**What landed:**
- `OnlyCue/Utilities/Time+Format.swift` — `TimeFormat.hms(_:)` returns `HH:MM:SS.mmm`, clamps negatives to zero, half-away-from-zero millisecond rounding. 7 unit tests covering zero, sub-second, minute/hour rollover, complex case, negatives, and sub-ms rounding.
- `OnlyCue/Media/PlayerEngine.swift` — `@Observable final class` wrapping `AVPlayer`. Exposes `currentTime`, `rate`, `duration` as observable state via the `Observation` framework; player and `timeObserver` use `@ObservationIgnored`. API: `play()`, `pause()`, `seek(to:)`, `load(asset:)`. Periodic time observer fires every 0.1s on the main queue. 4 unit tests using a programmatically-generated silent WAV (`AVAudioFile`) — no fixture media in the repo.
- `OnlyCue/UI/TransportBar.swift` — minimal SwiftUI transport: play/pause `Image` button toggling on `engine.rate > 0`, monospaced time readout via `TimeFormat.hms(engine.currentTime)`. `accessibilityIdentifier`s on both elements.
- `OnlyCue/UI/DocumentView.swift` — wired `@State private var engine = PlayerEngine()` per document and embedded `TransportBar(engine:)`.

**Review cycle (1 commit beyond initial 4):**
- Cycle 1: 3 optional suggestions on PR #17. Applied #3 (`load(asset:)` now resets `rate = 0` immediately, closing a ~100ms stale-rate window between `replaceCurrentItem(with:)` and the next periodic observer tick — commit `2240f5c`). Deferred #1 (`@MainActor`) and #2 (`rate != 0` vs `> 0`) per YAGNI: the reviewer's own framing was conditional ("once we cross threading boundaries", "if/when we support reverse playback"). Posted gh-comment explaining the deferral with reasoning.

**Key learnings:**
- `@Observable` + `@ObservationIgnored` is the right shape for engine-style classes that own non-observable resources (an `AVPlayer`, a periodic-time-observer token).
- Real assets (not mocks) for `seek`/`load` tests via `AVAudioFile.write(from:)` to a temp WAV. Keeps tests fast, hermetic, and realistic without committing binary fixtures.
- Establish convention for review feedback: apply unconditional correctness fixes; defer suggestions whose own framing is conditional on future events.

## 2026-05-07 — E1 skeleton session (PR #16, issue #3)

**Shipped:** issue #3 (E1 skeleton). PR #16 merged into `dev`. First feature epic — first real Swift code.

**What landed:**
- Data model under `OnlyCue/Document/`: `ProjectModel`, `Cue`, `MediaReference`, `MediaKind`. All `Codable`/`Equatable`; `Cue` is also `Identifiable`.
- `CueListDocument` (`final class : ReferenceFileDocument`) with JSON encode/decode using `[.prettyPrinted, .sortedKeys]`.
- `Info.plist` adds `UTExportedTypeDeclarations` (declares `com.onlycue.cuelist`) and `CFBundleDocumentTypes` (binds it to `CueListDocument` via `NSDocumentClass`).
- `OnlyCueApp` now uses `DocumentGroup`. `DocumentView` shows minimal placeholder (title + cue count + hint) — preview/waveform/cue list arrive in E4–E6.
- Tests: 3 unit tests in `ProjectModelTests` (round-trip with media, round-trip with nil media, format assertions) + 1 UI test in `DocumentLaunchTests` mapping the "Scenario: New document opens" Gherkin.
- Replaced C1 placeholder tests with real ones.

**Review cycles applied (3 commits beyond initial 6):**
- Cycle 1: SwiftLint `--strict` failed on test code — replaced 6 force-unwraps with `try XCTUnwrap`, fixed `String(decoding:)` per `optional_data_string_conversion`, fixed `multiline_arguments` on `XCTAssert*` calls. Hoisted fixed UUIDs into `static let` constants.
- Cycle 2: macOS `DocumentGroup` shows the launcher window on cold launch (not auto untitled doc), so the UI test never reached `DocumentView`. Drove the test through `app.typeKey("n", modifierFlags: .command)` to mirror the Gherkin "When the user creates a new document". Added `.accessibilityIdentifier("documentTitle")` and `.accessibilityIdentifier("cueCount")` to query by stable identifier.
- Cycle 3: `XCUIElement.label` returns empty string when querying SwiftUI `Text` by `accessibilityIdentifier`. Dropped both `.label` equality assertions; element existence under the identifier is sufficient evidence of the rendered content.

**Key learnings (captured in `docs/findings.md`-worthy items):**
- SwiftLint `--strict` applies to test code too. Use `try XCTUnwrap` over force-unwrap in tests.
- macOS `DocumentGroup` cold-launch shows launcher, not untitled document. UI tests must drive ⌘N first.
- XCUITest `.label` is unreliable when an element carries `accessibilityIdentifier` from a SwiftUI `Text`; rely on identifier resolution + `exists`/`waitForExistence` instead.

## 2026-05-07 — CI session (PR #15, issue #2)

**Shipped:** issue #2 (C2 CI). PR #15 merged into `dev`. First PR using the new dev-as-default flow.

**What landed:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — single `build-test` job on `macos-latest`, ~25 min timeout.
- Pipeline: checkout → `maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1` (latest stable Xcode) → `brew install xcodegen swiftlint xcbeautify` → `swiftlint lint --strict --reporter github-actions-logging` → `xcodegen generate` → `actions/cache@v4` (DerivedData + SPM) → `xcodebuild build` Debug → `xcodebuild test`. Build/test piped through `xcbeautify --renderer github-actions` for proper annotations.
- Triggers: `pull_request` (any branch) and `push` to `main` or `dev`.
- Concurrency: `cancel-in-progress` per ref.
- Code signing disabled (signing is C3's job).

**Coverage of reviewer feedback from PR #14:**
- SwiftLint must fail CI on absent or violating — `--strict` mode + natural `brew install` failure mode covers both.

**Out of scope (deferred):**
- Code signing in CI → C3 (#13).
- Release builds in CI → C3.
- Branch protection (require CI green + 1 review) → repo Settings UI, not committable.

**Verification:** the PR's own check run was the first exercise of the workflow — green on first run.

## 2026-05-07 — Bootstrap session (PR #14, issue #1)

**Shipped:** issue #1 (C1 bootstrap). PR #14 merged via rebase into `main`.

**What landed:**
- Repo metadata (linked the GitHub remote, 23 labels, 3 milestones, 13 issues — 10 epics + 3 chores).
- All planning docs under `docs/` (vision, mvp-scope, architecture, data-model, build-sequence, verification, roadmap, decisions).
- Approved spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-repo-issues-design.md`.
- Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-07-repo-issues.md` + 13 issue body templates committed under `docs/superpowers/plans/issue-bodies/`.
- Setup scripts: `docs/superpowers/plans/setup-labels.sh`, `setup-milestones.sh` (idempotent).
- Project skeleton: `project.yml` (xcodegen 2.45.4), `OnlyCue.xcodeproj` generated and gitignored.
- Folder layout per `docs/architecture.md`: App / Document / Media / UI / Commands / Utilities / Resources.
- Minimal Swift placeholders so the project compiles (real implementations live in E1 onward).
- Configs: `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.swiftlint.yml` (with `unused_import` correctly under `analyzer_rules`), `Info.plist`.
- GitHub templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{epic,leaf,chore,bug}.md` + 7 forked PR templates with the OnlyCue verification footer (the original 6 from the gh-pr skill plus a new `chore.md` extending the skill's mapping).
- `CLAUDE.md` with PR template override rule, commit conventions, branching rules, and hard rules.

**Review feedback applied (commit `4bac6bf` after rebase):**
- Bundle ID changed to `com.chienchuanw.OnlyCue` (reverse-DNS must be a domain we control).
- `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS: YES` for Release config (Debug stays NO).
- Dropped duplicate `DEVELOPMENT_LANGUAGE: en` from target settings.
- Removed redundant `*.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/swiftpm/` from `.gitignore`.
- Rewrote `chore.md` PR footer with chore-shaped items (tooling-verified-locally, no-behavioral-surface, spec/CLAUDE.md updated, CI green).
- Tracked SwiftLint CI enforcement on issue #2; tracked placeholder-test deletion as a leaf on issue #3.

**Branching change:** `dev` is now the default branch on the remote. Issue branches base off `dev`. Production code is on `main`. CLAUDE.md updated to reflect this.

**Tooling installed this session:**
- `xcodegen` (2.45.4) via Homebrew — generates `OnlyCue.xcodeproj` from `project.yml`.
