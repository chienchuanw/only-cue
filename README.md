# OnlyCue

A native macOS application for lighting designers and show programmers, inspired by [CuePoints](https://cuepoints.com/). Import a media file (audio or video), preview it, and lay out a **cue list** — an ordered set of named, color-coded markers anchored to timestamps — to plan and communicate timing for live shows or TV.

## Status

C1 bootstrap, C2 CI, E1 skeleton, E2 player core, E3 media import, E4 video preview, E5 waveform, E6 cue list pane, and E7 add/edit/delete cues have shipped ([#14](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/pull/14)–[#22](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/pull/22)). Documents are now live editors: `M` adds a cue at the playhead, double-click to rename inline, swatch button opens an 8-color palette popover, `⌫` deletes the selected row. Every mutation flows through `OnlyCue/Commands/CueCommands.swift` and is undoable via `UndoManager` (⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z), with action names in the Edit menu. Next up: [#10](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/issues/10) (E8 cue markers on waveform — draw markers at correct x-positions, drag to retime, click to seek). Track everything on the [issue board](https://github.com/chienchuanw/only-cue/issues).

## Build

```bash
brew install xcodegen swiftlint   # one-time
xcodegen generate                  # produces OnlyCue.xcodeproj from project.yml
open OnlyCue.xcodeproj
```

`OnlyCue.xcodeproj/` is generated and gitignored — `project.yml` is the source of truth.

### When to re-run xcodegen / clean the build folder

- **Re-run `xcodegen generate`** whenever `project.yml`, `Info.plist`, or the source folder structure changes (new top-level folder under `OnlyCue/`, new target, new pre-build script). Pulling a branch that touched any of those counts.
- **`⌘⇧K` (Clean Build Folder)** in Xcode after switching branches that changed Swift concurrency annotations or other compile-time invariants — Xcode's incremental build sometimes hangs on stale bitcode and surfaces it as a confusing build error (e.g., a Swift 6 `@MainActor` error on code that has already been fixed).
- **`⌘⇧⌥K` (Delete Derived Data)** if `⌘⇧K` doesn't clear the issue. Slower (full rebuild after) but resolves persistent stale-cache errors.
